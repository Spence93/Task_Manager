# Task_Manager
My final capstone project with Hyperion Dev on my software engineering bootcamp
In this task we had to modfify and refactor an existing program using the principle of abstrction.

The program itself is a task manager, that allows the user to add and manage assigned work tasks. You can also edit tasks, and assign tasks to different users.
Other features include:
* A login system
* A user friendly UI
* Generated reports with relevant data
* Admin specific features

### Installation
Download the three .py files:
- data_report_functions
- menu_functions
- task_manger

You do not require the task.txt and user.txt files, but you can use the tasks and users currently stored there if you prefer.

The user and task overview.txt files will be generated in the program, there is no need to download these.


## Using the program

### If you did not download the tasks.txt and user.txt
On your first login, use:
Username: admin
Password: password

From here you can add your own users and tasks, and the files will be created as needed.

### If you did download the tasks.txt and user.txt files
You can still loging using the admin, or choose from any of the other users that are stored in the user.txt file

Follow the on screen instructions to navigate through the program, to add new users, tasks, and to view all tasks or the current users assigned tasks.

### Note
The Display statistics can only be accessed by the admin account on the program
